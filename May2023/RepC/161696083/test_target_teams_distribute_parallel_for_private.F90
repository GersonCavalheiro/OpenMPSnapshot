!===--- test_target_teams_distribute_parallel_for_private.F90 ---------------===
!
! OpenMP API Version 4.5 Nov 2015
! 
! This test check for a private variable within a pragma omp target teams 
! distribute parallel for. We use a private variable within a for loop and 
! assign it every iteration hoping that we won't get into data races. We do this 
! multiple times to improve testing. We assign a large number of threads and
! teams to try to increase parallelism and contention on the privatized variable
!
