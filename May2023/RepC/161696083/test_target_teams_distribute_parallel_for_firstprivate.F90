!===--- test_target_teams_distribute_parallel_for_firstprivate.F90 ----------===
!
! OpenMP API Version 4.5 Nov 2015
!
! This test check for a private variable within a pragma omp target teams 
! distribute parallel for that is initialized from the host through firstprivate
! clause. We use a private variable within a for loop and asign it every iteration
! hoping that we won't get into data races. We do this multiple times to improve
! testing.
